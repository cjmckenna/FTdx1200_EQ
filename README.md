This utility is designed to allow easy configuration of the EQ setting on the Yaesu FTdx-1200 radio.  It allows for realtime updates to the settings so that the user can monitor the effects while updating.

Controls are provided for both sets of EQ (proc on and proc off) and the user can selectivly turn the proc and EQ on and off to gauge the impact of the changes.

To use the utlity, download the MSI installer and execute it.  This will install the program in your program files directory and create a shortcut on your desktop.

Since these are self contained executables you do not need to have python on your system.

The program has selections at the bottom for setting your com port and baud rate.  Set these up before connecting to the radio with the connect button
